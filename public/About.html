    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Yo Earthlings! 👋 It’s me again — Bleebo Zorpzorp, first-class
      intergalactic wanderer, semi-certified space mechanic, and honorary member
      of the Galactic Taco Council. I’m broadcasting this message across every
      open frequency your species can pick up — so like, if this ends up on your
      toaster or that weird talking fridge, don’t freak out. Technology's weird
      like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      So anyway, lemme tell you a little about myself. I’m from Planet
      Glorbnar-7, where the skies are green, the oceans are gelatinous, and our
      national anthem is just 45 seconds of synchronized burping. We don't do
      "Mondays" or "taxes" — and we evolved past pants centuries ago. You're
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve been observing Earth for the past few decades — mostly for fun,
      sometimes for research, and occasionally because my hyperdrive GPS keeps
      glitching and sending me to the wrong timeline. Y’all are wild. One minute
      you’re landing on the Moon, next minute you're trying to dance on TikTok
      while eating cinnamon powder. What even is your species doing?? I love it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, BIG shoutout to whoever invented cheeseburgers, bubble wrap, and
      lo-fi beats. Seriously, I downloaded those into my neural cortex and now I
      can’t stop vibing. Y’all also invented sarcasm, conspiracy theories, and
      reality TV — truly chaotic-neutral energy, and I’m here for it. That said,
      please stop fighting over whose turn it is to rule the planet. You’re all
      squishy, just get along.
    </p>

      Now — I know what you’re thinking: "Bleebo, why don’t you land and hang
      out for real?" And trust me, I’ve thought about it. But have you seen how
      humans react when something has more than two eyes or doesn’t speak in
      emojis? I’m trying not to end up on one of your “Area 51” menus, okay?
      <br />
      Still, I believe in your potential. You’re creative, unpredictable, and
      incredibly stubborn — three traits we deeply admire out in the stars. So
      here’s my message to you: keep growing, keep questioning, keep being
      gloriously weird. And maybe — just maybe — someday you’ll join the
      Galactic Federation of Wiggly Weirdos (we’ve been saving a spot for you).
    </p>
    <p>
      Until then, if your lights flicker, your dog barks at nothing, or you feel
      like someone’s watching you while you microwave pizza rolls — don’t worry.
      It’s probably just me. Or Zleeg from Nebula-9. He’s a prankster. Either
      way — peace, love, and glowing tentacles. ✨🛸
    </p>
